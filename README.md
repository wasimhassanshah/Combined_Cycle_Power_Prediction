# Combined_Cycle_Power_Prediction
To develop a predictive model for full-load output power (PE) of Combined Cycle Power Plant usinf Linear Regression Random Forest and XG Boost Algorithms
Combined cycle power plants are power generation plants that use both gas and steam turbines together to generate electricity. 

# Objectibe
The Output power of the Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) is dependent on a few parameters which are atmospheric pressure, exhaust steam pressure, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. Being able to predict the full load electrical power output is important for the efficient and economic operation of the power plant.

# Model Development
Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost ALgorithms are used. Random Forest Regressor is found to be the best performing model
